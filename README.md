 ## Summary

This is a trail tracking app (similar to an AllTrails Clone). Users can keep track of trails they want to hike and trails they've completed. Users can favorite and unfavorite hikes, and rate hikes they have completed. Users can search trails and review details.  

## Instructions 

1. Clone down the [getTrails Backend Repo](https://github.com/marykang09/hikes_backend) and follow the readme instructions first. 

2. Clone down this repo and cd into the directory

3. In the highest level of the directory, create a .env file to store your google api key. [Get a google maps api key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). Your .env file should look like this: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=YourGoogleMapsAPIKey`

4. Run `npm install` 

5. Run `npm start`

6. Allow React to run on port 3001. 

7. Open http://localhost:3001
